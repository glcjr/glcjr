- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gary. I work as a software developer. I write mostly in c# and vb. If it were up to me, it would always be c# but work has other ideas. I prefer to write for the desktop over the web and mobile but I don't think its going back.
- I began writing with Basic with line numbers in the 80s. I then learned Pascal and Fortran in high school. In college I learned C, C++, Cobol, dBASE, Assembly Language, and CICS in the 90s. I returned to school and learned Java, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Asp.net. I also learned PHP but I seem to have forgotten everything.
- I also know some Python.

- ðŸ˜µis what its like to write XAML without a designer so @Microsoft better get its act together and get one for WINUI amd Maui
